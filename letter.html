<br/><b><u>The Honourable Sylvia Namaganda,</u> <br/>
Parliament of Uganda,<br/>
Committee on Finance,Planning and Economic Development,<br/>
P.O.Box 7127,<br/>
Kampala,Uganda.</b><br/>

<br/>Dear <b><u>Honourable Sylvia Namaganda</u></b>,<br/>
<p>I,herby,write to you this letter asking for assistance in funding a variety of projects that 
 I am starting.<br/>
 I am an Economist and software developer. I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Economics<br/>
 and I have also attained a Masters of Arts Degree in Economic Policy Management, from<br/>
 Makerere University Kampala.Recently, I became very interested in the ever increasing levels
 of youth unemployment.</p>

<p>According to recent research findings, the levels of youth unemployment in Uganda rose from 51%
in 2014 to 83% in 2017.<br/>The unemployment was separated into three parts:underemployment,seasonal
unemployment and classical unemployment.<br/>
For instance,in Kampala,it was discovered that underemployment, which is the under-use of a 
worker due to a job that does <br/>not use the worker's skills,leaves the worker idle was at 30%.
While,seasonal unemployment which is when the youth are unemployed <br/>at particular times of the year 
when demand for labour is lower than usual was found to be at 26% and finally, classical unemployment<br/>
which is when the youth when the wages a worker is willing to accept is in excess
of those an employer is willing to pay was found to be at 27%.<br/>
The unemployment has led to the some youth getting involved in illicit activities such as
drinking,theft,gang related activities and early pregnacy.<br/>

<br/>Therefore, I ask that you support the <b><i>"YOUTH EMPOWERMENT BILL"</i></b>. This is a bill that 
I drafted to help solve the youth unemployment crisis <br/>before it implodes.I supporting this bill,
funding will be provided to support youth start ups, rehabilitation programmes,internships to
be provided<br/>to the youth in specific companies and institutions.
All youth should have the opportunity to achieve their goals and dreams for a better future,<br/>
not only for themselves but also for the country and future generations to come.

</p>

Sincerely,<br/>
Okecho Joan
